Do something with MTG cards data.

### Description

This is a hobby project.

It started as a card data scraping from `MTG Goldfish`. Then, some JumpIn! packets info scraping 
was added. Then, there was some play with Limited data from `17lands.com` when I thought I had to 
bear with utter boringness of that format (before the dawn of Golden Packs on Arena). Then, I 
discovered I don't need to scrape anything because `Scryfall`.

Then, I quit.

Now, the main focus is `decks` and `yt` packages (parsing data on youtubers' decks from YT videos 
descriptions).
