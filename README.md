Scrape data on MtG decks.

### Description

This is a hobby project.

It started as a card data scraping from `MTG Goldfish`. Then, some JumpIn! packets info scraping 
was added. Then, there was some play with Limited data from [17lands](https://www.17lands.com) when 
I thought I had to bear with utter boringness of that format (before the dawn of Golden Packs on 
Arena) [_This part has been deprecated and moved to [archive](https://github.com/z33kz33k/mtg/tree/2d5eb0c758953d38ac51840ed3e49c2c25b4fe91/mtgcards/archive) package_]. Then, I discovered I 
don't need to scrape anything because [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com).

Then, I quit (Arena).

Now, the main focus is `deck` and `yt` packages (parsing data on youtubers' decks from 
YT videos descriptions).

### What works

* Scryfall data management via downloading bulk data with 
  [scrython](https://github.com/NandaScott/Scrython) and wrapping it in convenient abstractions
* Scraping YouTube channels for decklist-featuring video descriptions (or author's comments) - using 
  no less than four Python libraries to avoid bothering with Google APIs: 
    * [scrapetube](https://github.com/dermasmid/scrapetube),
    * [pytubefix](https://github.com/JuanBindez/pytubefix),
    * [youtubesearchpython](https://github.com/alexmercerind/youtube-search-python), 
    * [youtube-comment-downloader](https://github.com/egbertbouman/youtube-comment-downloader) 
* Parsing those descriptions (or author's comments) for decks:    
    * Pasted text decklists in Arena/MTGO format are parsed into Deck objects
    * Links to decklist sites are scraped into Deck objects. 43 sites are supported so far:
        * [17Lands](https://www.17lands.com)

        * [LigaMagic](https://www.ligamagic.com.br/?view=home)
        * [MTGCircle](https://mtgcircle.com)
    * 4 more decklist sites in plans

    * Link trees posted in descriptions/comments are expanded
    * Links to pastebin-like services (like [Amazonian](https://www.youtube.com/@Amazonian) does)
      , Patreon posts and Google Docs documents are expanded too and further parsed for decks
    * If nothing is found in the video's description (incl. title), then the author's comments are parsed
    * Deck's name and format are derived (from a video's title, description and keywords) if not readily available
    * Foreign cards and other that cannot be found in the downloaded Scryfall bulk data are looked 
      up with queries to the Scryfall API

* Assessing the meta:

    * (others in plans)
* Exporting decks into [XMage](https://xmage.today) .dck format, [Forge MTG](https://github.com/Card-Forge/forge) .dck format or Arena 
  decklist saved into a .txt file - with autogenerated, descriptive filenames based on scraped deck's 
  metadata
* Importing back into a Deck from those formats
* Export/import to other formats in plans
* Dumping data to JSON
* Semi-automatic discovery of new channels
* I compiled a list of **over 2.5k** YT channels that feature decks in their descriptions and successfully 
  scraped them (at least 25 videos deep) so this data only waits to be creatively used now!
