Scrape data on MtG decks.

### Description

This is a hobby project.

It started as a card data scraping from `MTG Goldfish`. Then, some JumpIn! packets info scraping 
was added. Then, there was some play with Limited data from [17lands](https://www.17lands.com) when 
I thought I had to bear with utter boringness of that format (before the dawn of Golden Packs on 
Arena) [_This part has been deprecated and moved to [archive](https://github.com/z33kz33k/mtg/tree/2d5eb0c758953d38ac51840ed3e49c2c25b4fe91/mtgcards/archive) package_]. Then, I discovered I 
don't need to scrape anything because [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com).

Then, I quit (Arena).

Now, the main focus is `decks` package and `yt` module (parsing data on youtubers' decks from YT videos 
descriptions).

### What works

* Scryfall data management via downloading bulk data with 
  [scrython](https://github.com/NandaScott/Scrython) and wrapping it in convenient abstractions
* Scraping YT channels for videos with decklists in descriptions (or comments) - using no less than 
  four Python libraries: [scrapetube](https://github.com/dermasmid/scrapetube), 
  [pytubefix](https://github.com/JuanBindez/pytubefix),  
  [youtubesearchpython](https://github.com/alexmercerind/youtube-search-python), and 
  [youtube-comment-downloader](https://github.com/egbertbouman/youtube-comment-downloader) to avoid bothering 
  with Google APIs)
* Scraping YT videos' descriptions (or comments) for decks:    
    * Text decklists in Arena/MTGO format pasted into video descriptions are parsed into Deck objects
    * Links to decklist services are scraped into Deck objects. 25 services are supported so far:
        * [Aetherhub](https://aetherhub.com)
        * [Archidekt](https://archidekt.com)
        * [Cardhoarder](https://www.cardhoarder.com)
        * [Cardsrealm](https://mtg.cardsrealm.com/en-us/)
        * [Deckstats.net](https://deckstats.net)
        * [Flexslot](https://flexslot.gg)
        * [Goldfish](https://www.mtggoldfish.com)
        * [Hareruya](https://www.hareruyamtg.com/en/)
        * [Manatraders](https://www.manatraders.com)
        * [ManaStack](https://manastack.com/home)
        * [Melee.gg](https://melee.gg)
        * [Moxfield](https://www.moxfield.com)
        * [MTGArena.Pro](https://mtgarena.pro)
        * [MTGAZone](https://mtgazone.com)
        * [MTGDecks.net](https://mtgdecks.net)
        * [MTGO Traders](https://www.mtgotraders.com/store/index.html)
        * [MTGTop8](https://mtgtop8.com/index)
        * [PennyDreadfulMagic](https://pennydreadfulmagic.com)
        * [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com)
        * [StarCityGames](https://starcitygames.com)
        * [Streamdecker](https://www.streamdecker.com/landing)
        * [TappedOut](https://tappedout.net)
        * [TCGPlayer](https://infinite.tcgplayer.com)
        * [TopDecked](https://www.topdecked.com)
        * [Untapped](https://mtga.untapped.gg) 
    * Other decklist services are in plans (but, it does seem like I've pretty much exhausted the 
      possibilities already :))
    * Both Untapped decklist types featured in YT videos are supported: regular deck and profile deck
    * Both old and new TCGPlayer sites are supported
    * Both international and Japanese Hareruya sites are supported 
    * Due to their dynamic nature, Untapped, TCGPlayer (new site), ManaStack, Flexslot and TopDecked 
      are scraped using [Selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/Selenium). It's also used to scrape MTGTop8, MTGDecks.net and 
      Cardhoarder, even though those are very much static sites. Selenium is still helpful here 
      (either to click a consent button or bypass anti-bot measures)
    * All those mentioned above work even if they are behind shortener links and need unshortening first
    * Text decklists in links to pastebin-like services (like [Amazonian](https://www.youtube.com/@Amazonian) does) work too
    * If nothing is found in the video's description, then the author's comments are parsed
    * Deck's name and format are derived if not readily available
    * Foreign cards and other that cannot be found in the downloaded Scryfall bulk data are looked 
      up with queries to the Scryfall API
* Assessing the meta:
    * Scraping Goldfish and MGTAZone for meta-decks (others in plans)
    * Scraping a singular Untapped meta-deck decklist page
* Exporting decks into a [Forge MTG](https://github.com/Card-Forge/forge) .dck format or Arena 
  decklist saved into a .txt file - with autogenerated, descriptive names based on scraped deck's 
  metadata
* Importing back into a Deck from those formats
* Export/import to other formats in plans
* Dumping decks, YT videos and channels to .json
* I compiled a list of **almost 1.1k** YT channels that feature decks in their descriptions and successfully 
  scraped them (at least 25 videos deep) so this data only waits to be creatively used now!
